# R code description:
    
    # Simulation of data to assess primary and secondary outcomes (MAD-mean accuracy and variable selection) for the four data scenarios is in the following files:
    #      1) common_bin_cat_inputs_for_pub.R
    #      2) common_bin_mixed_inputs_for_pub.R
    #      3) rare_bin_cat_inputs_for_pub.R
    #      4) rare_bin_mixed_inputs_for_pub.R
    
    # To assess simulated data for primary and secondary outcomes and produce graphs & tables in the manscript:
    #      1) Outcome analysis for bin outcomes with cat inputs_for_pub.R
    #      2) Outcome analysis for bin outcomes with mixed inputs_for_pub.R
    
    # To create simulated data for sensitivity analysis 1 (assess MAD-mean for a 50% prevalence outcome):
    #      1) sensitivity analysis_preval_50.R
    
    # To assess simulated data for sensitivity analysis 1:
    #      1) Outcome analysis for sensitivity analysis for MAD_mean for 50% prevalence outcome .R
    
    # To create simulated data for sensitivity analysis 2 (assess bias and variance of estimations):
    #      1) sensitivity analysis_bias_var_rare_bin.R
    #      2) sensitivity analysis_bias_var_common_bin.R
    #      3) sensitivity analysis_bias_var_preval_50_bin.R
    
    # To assess simulated data for sensitivity analysis 2:
    #      1) Outcome analysis for sensitivity analysis for bias_var_for_pub.R
